### Usage
#### File formats and editing
Text and presentation files are provided as [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) files. This is an open source publishing format based on markdown. Quarto files can be edited using text editors and IDEs such as R Studio and rendered to any format: `docx`, `pdf`, `html`. You can preview the contents of the OER directly on GitHub in files with `.md` extension and `.html` files are provided in the Zenodo repository. 

If you would like to edit the OER and export it e.g. to Word or PDF, you can do it in three ways. 

1. Edit `.html` files provided on Zenodo
2. Edit and render Quarto files

   First, clone the repository.
     - Open the file in R Studio, set the following line to your preferred format, e.g.: 
    ```         
    format: pdf
    ```
    And click `Render`.
    - Change the line as above using any text editor and use Quarto CLI to render it:
    ```         
    quarto render
    ```
